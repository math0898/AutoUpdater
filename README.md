# Paper Autoupdater

## System Requirements

- __Java JDK__ - _Need a Java development kit. Version should be the latest available._
- __Git__ - _Used to build the paper jar using paperweight. Git can be installed using your package manager of choice._
  - Paperweight also requires that you specify a git identity. Run the following commands with a username/email of your choice:
    - `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
    - `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
- __RAM__ - _Building failed for me at 4 GB of RAM and worked at 8 GB of RAM. This is with a WaterfallCord server and Minecraft server instance running._
